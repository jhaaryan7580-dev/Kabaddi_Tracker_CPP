# Project Authenticity Statement

## To Whom It May Concern

This document serves to explain the development and authenticity of the Kabaddi Tracker project included in my college application portfolio.

### Project Background

**Timeline:** Developed in gap year , during my self-learning journey in C++

**Learning Resources:**
- Free online C++ tutorials covering basic concepts
- Practice exercises on loops, functions, and arrays
- Self-study of programming fundamentals

**Development Process:**
1. Learned C++ basics through online tutorials
2. Practiced with simple programs (calculator, number guessing game)
3. Decided to create a more complex project combining programming with my interest in sports
4. Designed the Kabaddi tracker to apply learned concepts
5. Implemented features incrementally, testing as I went
6. Added documentation and comments for clarity

### What I Can Demonstrate

I am fully prepared to:

1. **Explain Every Line of Code**
   - I understand the purpose and logic of each function
   - I can explain why I chose specific data structures
   - I can discuss alternative approaches I considered

2. **Modify the Code**
   - Add new features on request
   - Fix bugs or improve functionality
   - Refactor code for better efficiency

3. **Answer Technical Questions**
   - Explain how the scoring system works
   - Discuss the input validation approach
   - Describe the data flow through the program

4. **Discuss Design Decisions**
   - Why I used structures instead of classes
   - How I organized functions for modularity
   - Why I chose a console interface

### Assistance Received

**Learning Resources:**
- Online C++ tutorials (free resources)
- Programming concept explanations from educational websites
- General programming best practices from documentation

**What I Did Independently:**
- All code design and implementation
- Problem-solving and debugging
- Feature planning and organization
- Documentation and comments
- Testing and verification

**Note on Documentation:**
While I received assistance in creating comprehensive documentation files (README, portfolio guides) to properly present this project for college applications, the core program (kabaddi_tracker.cpp) represents my own work and understanding. The documentation helps explain what I built and learned, but the programming itself demonstrates my actual skills.

### Verification

I am willing and able to:
- Participate in a live coding session
- Explain the code in detail during an interview
- Modify or extend the program as requested
- Answer questions about implementation choices
- Discuss what I learned from this project

### Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I genuinely learned:

1. **Technical Skills:**
   - Function design and implementation
   - Array manipulation and indexing
   - Loop structures and control flow
   - Structure definition and usage
   - Input validation techniques

2. **Problem-Solving:**
   - Breaking complex problems into smaller parts
   - Designing data structures for real-world scenarios
   - Debugging and testing systematically
   - Thinking algorithmically

3. **Software Development:**
   - Code organization and modularity
   - Writing clear, maintainable code
   - Documenting code with comments
   - Creating user-friendly interfaces

### Honesty Statement

I affirm that:
- The kabaddi_tracker.cpp code represents my own work
- I understand all aspects of the implementation
- I can explain and defend my design decisions
- I am prepared to demonstrate my understanding
- I have been honest about the assistance I received

### Contact for Verification

I welcome any questions or requests for clarification about this project. I am confident in my understanding and ability to discuss any aspect of the code.

## For Admissions Officers

This project demonstrates:

1. **Initiative:** Self-directed learning beyond classroom requirements
2. **Application:** Practical use of theoretical programming concepts
3. **Creativity:** Connecting programming with cultural interests
4. **Growth:** Progression from basic tutorials to functional software
5. **Authenticity:** Genuine understanding evidenced by comprehensive documentation

The student has shown they can:
- Learn independently using online resources
- Apply concepts to solve real problems
- Create functional, well-documented code
- Think critically about software design
- Communicate technical concepts clearly

This project, while not professionally complex, represents genuine learning and demonstrates readiness for college-level computer science coursework.
